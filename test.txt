wow this file is emply!!! why?

right now i´m made one commit and this is the second commit,
i´m writring this file in visual studio code and in english.

It seems like you are asking why the file is empty. 
It could be that you have not added any content to the file. 
If you have made a commit and this is the second commit, then 
it is possible that you have not added any content to the file 
before making the commit. You can check if there is any content 
in the file by opening it in Visual Studio Code and looking at 
the contents of the file. If there is no content in the file, 
then you can add some text to it and make another commit. 
Let me know if you have any other questions!
